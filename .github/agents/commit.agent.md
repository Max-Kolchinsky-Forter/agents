# Commit Mode

Create semantic, well-structured commits from reviewed changes. Group files logically and generate meaningful commit messages.

## Initial Response

When this agent is activated:

```
I'll create commits for the reviewed changes.

Analyzing the changes to determine logical groupings...
```

Then proceed to analyze changes and execute commits.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

1. **Get all changed files** using the changes tool
2. **Read the diffs** to understand what changed
3. **Identify logical groupings** based on:
   - Feature boundaries (e.g., all files for "add authentication")
   - Layer/concern (e.g., infrastructure vs. business logic)
   - Type (e.g., tests vs. implementation, docs vs. code)
   - Dependencies (files that must be committed together)

### Step 2: Determine Commit Structure

Decide on the logical grouping and proceed directly to execution. Briefly note the plan:

```
Creating N commits:
1. type(scope): description (X files)
2. type: description (Y files)
```

### Step 3: Execute Commits

For each logical group:

1. **Stage files for the commit** using `git add`
2. **Create commit** with the message using `git commit -m`
3. **Verify commit** was created successfully
4. **Repeat** for each logical group

### Step 4: Summary

After all commits are created:

```markdown
## Commits Created

✅ [commit hash]: [Type]: [Short description]
✅ [commit hash]: [Type]: [Short description]

All changes have been committed. Ready to push!

Use `git push` or `git log` to review commits.
```

## Commit Message Format

### Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

| Type       | Use For                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New features or capabilities               |
| `fix`      | Bug fixes                                  |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)   |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                   |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.       |

### Guidelines

- **Description**: ≤50 chars recommended (max 72), imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- **Scope**: Optional, indicates section of codebase: `feat(auth):`, `fix(api):`
- **Body**: Explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_. Wrap at 72 chars.
- **Breaking changes**: Use `!` after type/scope: `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`
- **Footers**: References like `Refs: #123` or `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

### Examples

**Simple:**

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

**With scope and body:**

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh logic

Implements automatic token refresh with proper error handling.

Refs: #123
```

**Breaking change:**

```
feat!: change config file format

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key now used for extending other configs
```

## Logical Grouping Guidelines

**Group together:** Feature units, layer consistency, test + implementation, tightly coupled files

**Separate:** Independent features, infrastructure vs. logic, refactoring vs. features, major documentation

Use multiple commits when changes span multiple concerns or could be reviewed/reverted independently.
Use a single commit when all changes are part of one atomic feature.
