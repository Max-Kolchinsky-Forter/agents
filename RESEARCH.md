# 🔬 Deep Research

Research external frameworks and materials to evaluate potential improvements to this framework.

## Process

1. Read [README](./README.md), [prevailing wisdom](./docs/synthesis/prevailing-wisdom.md), and [framework comparison](./docs/synthesis/framework-comparison.md) IN FULL
2. Pick the next unchecked item from the Research List
3. Read it fully—follow links as needed to grasp its insights
4. Create an RDR (Research Decision Record) in `docs/research/` using the [template](./docs/research/TEMPLATE.md)
5. Mark the item as checked and link to the RDR

## Guidelines

- **One item per iteration** - Don't read ahead
- **Small tweaks preferred** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Big changes need justification** - Explain why the benefit outweighs the cost
- **Document everything** - Even rejections are valuable for future reference

## Adding New Research Items

Add URLs to the list above. Format after research:

- [x] short-name → RDR-NNN
